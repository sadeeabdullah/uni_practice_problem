# Array Operations in C

Welcome to the **Array Operations in C** repository!  
This project contains simple yet essential C programs that perform a variety of operations on arrays. These programs are excellent for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of array manipulation in C.

## Programs Included

1. **Find Duplicates**  
   Write a C program to find and display duplicate elements in an array.

2. **Insert an Element**  
   Write a C program to insert a new element into a specified position in an array.

3. **Delete an Element**  
   Write a C program to delete a specified element from an array.

4. **Print Array in Reverse**  
   Write a C program to print all elements of an array in reverse order.

5. **Search for an Element**  
   Write a C program to search for a specific element in an array and display its position.

6. **Sort an Array**  
   Write a C program to sort the elements of an array in ascending or descending order.

7. **Delete All Duplicate Elements**  
   Write a C program to remove all duplicate elements from an array.

8. **Print Unique Elements**  
   Write a C program to print only the unique (non-repeated) elements of an array.

9. **Print Frequency of Each Element**  
   Write a C program to display the frequency (number of occurrences) of each element in an array.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/array-operations-c.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd array-operations-c
   ```
3. Compile any C file using a compiler like `gcc`. Example:
   ```bash
   gcc find_duplicates.c -o find_duplicates
   ./find_duplicates
   ```

> _Each file is independent and can be compiled and run separately._

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of C programming
- A C compiler (such as `gcc`)
